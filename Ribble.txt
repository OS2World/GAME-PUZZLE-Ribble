Ribble is an advanced hand-eye-coordination tutor.  Using only a
small green reptile (duct-tape optional), you will find that
your ability to dodge rocks and monsters will improve beyond
belief.

To install Ribble, use the Install.exe program included in
this archive.

Ribble includes pretty extensive on-line help, so that's where
you'll find details about what Ribble really is, and how to
use it.

See the on-line help for information concerning warranties.

Enjoy.
