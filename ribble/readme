Source code for Ribble v1.00

--------

--------

This archive should unzip to contain the following directories:

./ribble                 Ribble source code
./ribble/Bitmaps         Bitmaps
./ribble/bcos2           Borland C++ .prj files
./ribble/help            Online-help files
./ribble/install         Install source code
./ribble/Levels          Ribble game levels
./ribble/Ribble          Source & headers
./ribble/watcom          Watcom project
./support                Contains support classes
./support/Watcom/os2     OS/2 target .lib
./support/Watcom/Win31   Win31 target .lib
./support/Watcom         Watcom project
./support/Win            Window library classes

To compile and run the source code, you will need the following tools
installed on your machine:

1) Borland C++ for OS/2 1.0 (or higher)
2) CPP.EXE from Borland C++ for OS/2
3) A version of SED

(2) and (3) are only required by the makehelp.cmd script in
./ribble/help.

Create a directory named "src" in the root directory of one
of your partitions.  Copy the support and ribble directories
into this "src" directory.  I use "D:\src".  I hope I've
removed all the drive-dependencies.

If you have (1), (2), and (3) then the makedist.cmd script should take
care of building the executables and creating the distribution
directory.

Ribble has been sucessfully compiled with Borland C++ for OS/2
v1.0, Watcom C/C++ 10.0 and IBM's CSet++.

Project (.prj) files for BCOS2 are located within in the
./ribble/bcos2 directory.  If you have IBM CSet++, then you will need
to create makefiles yourself.  Sorry.

--------

If you're not interested in the source code, a separate archive
ribble10.zip contains all the files required to install and run
Ribble.

Enjoy.
